To create a new snippet, open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `p` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `p` on macOS).

And look for an option that reads `Preferences: Configure User Snippets`.

There, you should be able to select from a drop down of languages for which you can create a new snippet.
